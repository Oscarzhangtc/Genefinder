# GeneFinder

DNA sequence from a sample strain of Salmonella is analyzed for any pathogenic (disease causing) genes. To do this, the program outputs snippets of DNA that are likely to be protein-coding genesâ€”a process known as gene finding or gene prediction. Then, the snippets can be used in genetic search engine such as protein-BLAST to confirm whether or not the genes predicted by the program are close matches to known genes, and if so, whether their function is pathogenic. Protein-BLAST contains a database in which there are various strains of Salmonella bacterium and their genes have already been identified and logged, including strains that are known to cause diseases such as Typhoid fever (Salmonella enterica typhi).
